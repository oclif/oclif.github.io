Plugins are a way to share code between CLIs, to modularize a CLI's codebase, and to allow users to add functionality to an existing CLI. With Node, we can have separate dependency versions sitting alongside one another. As a result, if you want to release an update to a dependency in one plugin, it doesn't affect how another plugin works. oclif takes this to an extreme so that even flag parsing is done at the individual plugin level. For example, if we ever want to make a breaking change to flag parsing (don't worry, we don't intend to!), you can update just one plugin and keep the old behavior in other plugins.
